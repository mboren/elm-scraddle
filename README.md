## Scraddle
An app for checking if something is a valid scrabble word.
To improve conversion rates and performance, rather than looking the word up,
this app simply adds the word to the English language.

## Getting started

You need to have [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 0.19 installed on your machine.

Compile this project with:

    elm make src/Main.elm

Then view it:
